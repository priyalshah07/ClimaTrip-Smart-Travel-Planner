## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **OpenWeather API**: Real-time weather conditions for destinations
- **Historical Weather Datasets**: Monthly state-level climate data from UCI datasets
- **Web Scraping**: Tourist attractions from "My Joy-Filled Life" and monthly travel recommendations from "Unmissable Trips"

### Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core application logic and data processing
- **Gradio**: Web interface framework
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing for web scraping
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Requests**: API integration and web requests
- **SSL**: Secure data access configuration

### Key Components
- **Data Integration Pipeline**: Combines multiple data sources for comprehensive results
- **Caching System**: Stores scraped data in CSV format for improved reliability
- **Input Validation**: Robust date parsing and error handling
- **State Mapping System**: Standardized state code-to-name dictionary for consistent references
